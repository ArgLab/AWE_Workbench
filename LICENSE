ENGLISH ABSTRACTNESS/CONCRETENESS RATINGS

    The concreteness ratings provided here are calculated from the concreteness ratings supplied by:

    Scott GG, Keitel A, Becirspahic M, Yao B, Sereno SC. The Glasgow Norms: Ratings of 5,500 words on nine scales. Behav Res Methods. 2019 Jun;51(3):1258-1270. doi: 10.3758/s13428-018-1099-3. PMID: 30206797; PMCID: PMC6538586.

    This resource contains a list of more than 5,500 words, rated on multiple scales including concreteness, and is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538586/#). Relevant information extracted from this resource, edited to make the words listed map directly onto the first sense of a relevant WordNet synset, is contained in the data directory as the file Concr_Base.csv. This information is then used to impute concreteness ratings based on WordNet synset relationships, using the program PrepareConcr.py. Concreteness ratings are provided per word and part of speech, rather than per word as in most other concreteness resources.
