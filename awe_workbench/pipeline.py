# Notes on the modules called here to be added to our parser pipeline

# from spacytextblob.spacytextblob import SpacyTextBlob
# https://github.com/SamEdwardes/spaCyTextBlob
# wrapper for TextBlob, https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob, which
# offers other NLP services. But the sentiment features contribute
# something that Spacy does not come with out of the box.
# SpacyTextBlob sentiment analysis gives subjectivity dimension,
# not just positive/negative polarity. To get this to work with holmes,
# we need to use forked version of holmes extractor that supports
# insertion of spacy components into it spacy pipeline.
#
# lexicalFeatures
# Module that adds features reflecting lexical properties to tokens, including
# the number of syllables, the number of morphemes, the size of morphological
# word families, the number of word senses, the presence of academic or
# latinate vocabulary, and other odds and ends such as identifying the
# root word of a word's word family
#
# syntaxDiscourseFeats
# Module that adds features reflecting syntax and discourse features,
# such as paragraph length, sentence length and complexity, length of
# coreference chains between pronouns, number and distriution of transition
# words, and measures of text cohesion such as cosine similarity of content
# words between adjacent sentences, before and after transition words, or
# between adjacent ten-word blocks.
#
# viewpointFeatures
# Module that identifies perspective, tone, stance, subjectivity related
# elements, including important aspects of argumentation and narrative
#
# lexicalClusters
# Module that clusters the words inside a document by cosine similarity
# using Spacy's native tok2vec vectors
#
# contentSegmentation
# module that rougly identifies main ideas/supporting ideas/details in
# argument-style texts.
